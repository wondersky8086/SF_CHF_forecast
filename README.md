The following codes can be used to replicate the tables and charts in the thesis "Forecasting Age-Specific Survival Functions with Application to Annuity Pricing":

Run "AUS_SF_code.R" to generate the survival function data.

Run "AUS_HZ_code.R" to generate the cumulative hazard function data.

Use "Annuity_calc_code_SF.R" and "Annuity_calc_code_HZ.R" to replicate the annuity calculation for each function respectively.

Reproduce all the charts in the thesis using "Plots for SF.R" for survival function and "Plots for HZ.R" for cumulative hazard function.

The two data text files represent male and female life tables from the Australian population respectively.
